The keyboard layout used by Jérôme Kunegis. 

        "I use this keyboard layout." --Jérôme Kunegis


== How to use on Ubuntu == 

(tested on 14.04 and 16.04 with Unity)

* Copy the file 'jxk' to /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/
 
* Insert the following snippet into the file /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml

     <layout>
      <configItem>
        <name>jxk</name>
        <shortDescription>en</shortDescription>
        <description>Jérôme's Keyboard Layout</description>
        <languageList>
          <iso639Id>en</iso639Id>
        </languageList>
      </configItem>
      <variantList/>
</layout>

(insert it just before </layoutList>)

Note:  we declare the new keyboard layout to be for the language
"English".  It doesn't work to invent a new language code for it. 

* Reboot (Just doing what ./keys does it not enough for it to work
  through Unity)  

* "Jérôme's keyboard layout" is now available in Unity's keyboard
  layout selection menu.  It is registered as a keyboard layout for
  the English language, and therefore will appear as "EN₁" or similar
  in the task bar. 

In Ubuntu 18.04:  I had to insert the content of 'jxk' into a preexisting layout; a new layout was not shown by the UI, but accepted by xmodmap.

If you want to test changes in it, use './keys'.
