The keyboard layout use by Jérôme Kunegis. 
 
How to use on Ubuntu 14.4 with Unity:

* Copy the file 'jxk' to /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/
 
* Insert the following snippet into the file /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml

     <layout>
      <configItem>
        <name>jxk</name>
        <shortDescription>en</shortDescription>
        <description>Jérôme's Keyboard Layout</description>
        <languageList>
          <iso639Id>en</iso639Id>
        </languageList>
      </configItem>
      <variantList/>
    </layout>

(insert it just before </layoutList>)

* Reboot and then it appears in the menu as "EN₁" (Just doing what
  ./keys does it not enough for it to work through Unity)

* (If you want to test changes in it, use ./keys)
